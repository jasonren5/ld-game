# outvoyage

In Outvoyage, you must navigate a never ending asteroid field while voyaging to the deepest depths of the universe. The game is hosted online using GitHub's pages feature. You can play here: [https://jasonren5.github.io/outvoyage/](https://jasonren5.github.io/outvoyage/).

I developed Outvoyage for the 48th Ludem Dare Compo, a game jam where developers are tasked with creating a video game in a weekend. This event's theme was 'Deeper and deeper'. This was made for the 'Compo' category, where contestants have only 48 hours instead of 72, are required to work alone, and the entire game must be made from scratch, including any assets such as textures, sounds, models, and not to mention code.
